# Contacts Management App 📒

A web application built with React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, allowing users to create, update, and delete contact information.



## Features 🌟

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js, utilizing the Tailwind CSS utility-first framework for styling.
- **Backend**: Developed using the Flask web framework in Python, providing a RESTful API for managing contacts.
- **Functionality**: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact information, including first name, last name, and email.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Local Development**: The project can be run locally using Docker for a seamless development experience.

- Enhance the UI with more modern and interactive design elements.

## What I Learned in This Project 📚

This Contact Management App was a great learning experience where I focused on understanding the **core concepts** rather than spending time on designing a visually appealing website.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Frontend with React:** I learned how to build interactive UI components using React, focusing more on functionality than design.
- **Backend with Python and Flask:** I gained hands-on experience in creating and managing APIs with Flask. I built endpoints, handled requests and responses, and managed routes for performing CRUD operations.
- **Creating and Managing API Calls:** I learned how to make API calls from the frontend and handle them on the backend to create, update, and delete contact information, including fields like name (first and last), email, and contact number.
- **Localhost Development:** I deployed the app on **localhost** and tested all functionality in a local environment before integrating it.

💡 **Note:** Since my primary focus was on understanding the core concepts and backend functionality, the frontend might not be as polished or visually appealing. I'm still learning frontend development and will improve my design skills in future projects.
